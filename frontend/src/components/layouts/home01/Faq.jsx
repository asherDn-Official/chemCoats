          text: "ESD flooring is provided as a controlled pathway for electrical charges to move safely to ground, thus preventing accumulation of static electricity. This is done by conductive capillaries, filaments, or fibers in the flooring material that collect static electricity from people or objects as they walk on the floor surface and safely prevents electrostatic discharge events to occur on sensitive electronic devices.",

          text: "Indeed, maintenance according to proper ESD flooring procedures is very important for achieving a successful ESD flooring system. However, regular cleaning with suitable material is required in order to preserve its conductive capacity. For example, StaticSmartÂ® ESD vinyl floor tile does not require wax or polish, but should be cleaned in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. In the same way, ESD carpet tiles have particular cleaning instructions in order to maintain static control properties.",

They comprise electronics manufacturing, data centers, pharmaceutical laboratories, cleanrooms and, aerospace facilities. There is a further wide adoption in the field of healthcare, such as operating rooms, where the static control plays the main role for the patient safety and the appliance functionality.",
