          text: "ESD flooring is designed to prevent the buildup of static electricity by providing a controlled pathway for electrical charges to dissipate safely to the ground. This is achieved through conductive veins, filaments, or fibers within the flooring material that draw static electricity away from people or objects as they move across the floor, protecting sensitive electronic equipment from electrostatic discharge events.",

          heading: "Does ESD flooring require special maintenance?",
          text: "Yes, proper maintenance is essential to ensure the effectiveness of ESD flooring. Regular cleaning with appropriate products is necessary to maintain its conductive properties. For instance, StaticSmartÂ® ESD vinyl tile does not require wax or polish but should be cleaned following the manufacturer's guidelines. Similarly, ESD carpet tiles have specific cleaning instructions to preserve their static control capabilities.",

These include electronics manufacturing, data centers, pharmaceutical labs, cleanrooms, and aerospace facilities. It is also commonly used in healthcare settings like operating rooms, where static control is critical for patient safety and equipment functionality.",
