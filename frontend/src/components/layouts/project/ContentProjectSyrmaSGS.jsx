            Syrma SGS, a prominent motherboard and electronics manufacturing
            company, required a specialized ESD (Electrostatic Discharge)
            flooring solution that could provide a highly controlled environment
            to prevent static build-up, which could potentially damage sensitive
            electronic components during production. To ensure the integrity of
            their high-tech manufacturing processes, Syrma SGS sought a flooring
            solution that would adhere precisely to the most stringent industry
            standards, including IEC 61340 and ANSI 2020 standards, which are
            internationally recognized for their effectiveness in managing
            electrostatic discharge in electronic manufacturing environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding the critical nature of this requirement, our team
            worked closely with Syrma SGS to design and implement an ESD
            flooring system that met all necessary specifications for
            conductivity, durability, and safety. The flooring solution we
            provided was not only compliant with IEC 61340 (which governs the
            requirements for ESD control in sensitive electronic environments)
            but also met the latest ANSI 2020 standards, ensuring it was up to
            date with the latest industry practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            By providing this highly controlled static current floor, we ensured
            that Syrma SGS could maintain a safe and efficient manufacturing
            process for their sensitive electronic components, eliminating the
            risk of electrostatic discharge damage. The successful
            implementation of this flooring solution demonstrated our ability to
            deliver custom, high-performance solutions that meet the most
            exacting standards in the electronics industry, ensuring compliance
            with industrial safety requirements while enhancing the overall
            operational efficiency of the facility.
